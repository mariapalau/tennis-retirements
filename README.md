**Abstract**: Purpose: The particularities of professional tennis and the high physical and psychological demands, together with the evolution of the game, impact on the number of retirements in the higher echelons of the game. The aim of this study was to analyze epidemiological patterns and risk factors associated with retirements in previous ATP and WTA Tour tournaments. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, covering the period between 1978-2019 in men, and 1994-2018 in women. Results: The results showed an overall incidence rate of 1.56 (95%CI: 1.54, 1.59) and 1.36 (95%CI: 1.33, 1.39) retirements per 1000 games played in male and female competitions, respectively. An increasing trend of retirements over the years was observed in both cases. Higher incidence rates in men and women were found in hard (1.59 [95%CI: 1.56, 1.63] and 1.39 [95%CI: 1.34, 1.44]) and clay (1.60 [95%CI: 1.57, 1.63] and 1.36 [95%CI: 1.32, 1.41]) when compared with grass courts (0.79 [95%CI: 0.65, 0.94] and 1.06 [95%CI: 0.88, 1.27]), while the effect of the other risk factors differed between genders, being the tournament category significant in male competitions (IRR: 1.23 (95%CI: 1.19, 1.28) in ITF vs ATP) and the match round in female tournaments (IRR: 0.92 (95%CI: 0.88, 0.98) in preliminary vs final). Conclusions: These findings can provide coaches, players, support team members, and epidemiologists with new insights on retirements and associated risk factors of matches in previous ATP and WTA Tour tournaments and help improve injury prevention.
